                           Installing gmqcc

1. Prerequisites
    - A C-Compiler such as gcc or clang
    - GNU Make or BSD Make

2. Compilation
    If using GNU make program
        make

    If using BSD make program, the BSDmakefile should be
    used instead when you invoke make, if however it ignores BSDmakefile
    you can supply it with -f.

        make -f BSDmakefile

    If no error appears, the following binary files will have been
    created:
        - gmqcc
        - qcvm
        - gmqpak

3. Installation
    The `install' target will install the 2 binaries to /usr/local/bin
    by default.
    The Makefile honors the following variables:

        - DESTDIR: The installation directory root.
        - PREFIX:  The installation prefix, default: /usr/local
        - BINDIR:  Directory for binary executables,
                   deafult: $PREFIX/bin

    To install to /usr/local run:

        make install

    To install to /usr run:

        make PREFIX=/usr install

    To install to a package-staging directory such as $pkgdir when
    writing a build script file:

        make DESTDIR=$pkgdir install
